      <h4>Slow Down.</h4>
      <p>At Vintage Heart, we believe a godo cup of coffee partnered with a bit of witty banter makes the world spin a little slower. We're a locally owned coffeehome and we just want to make your day a little more enjoyable.</p>
      <h4>Third Space</h4>
      <p>Vintage Heart has free wi-fi and copious amounts of plugs, so pull up a chair and get comfy. Our baristas are highly skilled, self-declared coffee nerds. They will also dominate you in scrabble </p>
      <h4>Local Coffee & Pastries</h4>
      <p>We are proud to brew the fair trade coffees and espresso from fellow locals thrid Coast Roasting Company. Those guys are great. They never sleep and choose to wear entire outfits out of denim. What's not to love?</p>
      <p>Russel's Bakery graces us with their fine pastries and Red Rabbit Cooperative Bakery provides crave-worthy vegan donuts, muffins, and brownies(oh my!) With house-made syrups(did someone say lavender?), we have your cofffe fix covered.</p>
